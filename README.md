# Simple Python Encryptor 🔐

A secure message encryption tool built with Python's `cryptography` library (Fernet). This project demonstrates my understanding of symmetric encryption and secure key handling.

## Features
* 🔑 **Key Generation:** Automatically generates a secure encryption key.
* 🔒 **AES-based Encryption:** Uses Fernet (AES-128 in CBC mode) for high security.
* 🛡️ **Error Handling:** Protects against corrupted data or incorrect keys.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Library:** `cryptography`

## How to use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python simple_encryptor.py`
